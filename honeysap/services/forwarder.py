class ForwarderService(BaseService):
    """The ForwarderService implements a HoneySAP service that forwards traffic
    to a target host/port. It can be used to easily integrate HoneySAP with
    other honeypots or actual services running on other hosts. By running it as
    a virtual service it's possible also to use it for forwarding internally
    routed traffic to external services running on the same or other hosts.


    Example configuration for a Kippo SSH honeypot directly exposed to the
    HoneySAP listener address::

        # Service configuration
        -
            service: ForwarderService
            alias: LocalSSHService

            enabled: yes

            listener_port: 22

            target_port: 2222
            target_address: 127.0.0.1


    Example configuration for an internal Kippo SSH honeypot running as a
    virtual service::

        # Service configuration
        -
            service: ForwarderService
            alias: InternalKippoService

            enabled: yes
            virtual: yes

            listener_port: 22
            listener_address: 10.0.0.2

            target_port: 22
            target_address: 127.0.0.1

        # SAPRouter route table
        - action: allow
          mode: raw
          target: 10.0.0.2
          port: 22
          password:

    In this scenario is possible to provide access to a Kippo honeypot running
    on the local machine, through the SAPRouter service.
